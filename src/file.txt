Ironically for a game set in ancient Greece, Assasin's Creed Odysser is anything but Spartan.
This epic-scale action-roleplaying game shines as a grand adventure through a magnificient and beautiful open world on a scale we've rarely seen.
With so few compromises between quantity and quality, Odyssey vaults over its predecessors to become the most impressive gmae in the history of the series.

Assasin's creed odyssey begins more than 2,400 Years ago at the onset of the peloponnesian war: a deacades long struggle between Athens and Sparta for dominion over the ancient Greek world.
It's a fitting period to explore that's rife with social and political intrigue, full-scale warfare on land and sea, and a tangible air of myth and legend.
And after an astonishing 60 plus hours of galloping, sailing, and slicing through that historical fiction sandbox, it's easy to see why it was worth fighting so hard over
